### Hi, my name is Sebastian

I like long walks on the beach and writing software.

- Father
- CTO of [kartenmacherei](https://www.celebrate.company/die-kartenmacherei?lang=en)
- Disciple of the boring code movement
- Video game nerd

I believe in the philosophy of servant leadership and try to break down barriers. I value simplicity and maintainability over raw performance. I favour being part of a product for its whole lifecycle and building lasting relationships over maximizing profit.
